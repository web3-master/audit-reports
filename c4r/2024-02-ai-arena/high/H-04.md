# Fighters cannot be minted after the initial generation due to uninitialized numElements mapping
## Impact
In FighterFarm.sol there is a mapping numElements which stores the number of possible types of elements a fighter can have in a generation:
```solidity
FighterFarm.sol#L84-L85

    /// @notice Mapping of number elements by generation.
    mapping(uint8 => uint8) public numElements;
```
But the problem here is that only the initial generation, Generation 0, is initialized to 3, in the numElements mapping during the constructor of FighterFarm.sol.
```solidity
FighterFarm.sol#L100-L111

    /// @notice Sets the owner address, the delegated address.
    /// @param ownerAddress Address of contract deployer.
    /// @param delegatedAddress Address of delegated signer for messages.
    /// @param treasuryAddress_ Community treasury address.
    constructor(address ownerAddress, address delegatedAddress, address treasuryAddress_)
        ERC721("AI Arena Fighter", "FTR")
    {
        _ownerAddress = ownerAddress;
        _delegatedAddress = delegatedAddress;
        treasuryAddress = treasuryAddress_;
        numElements[0] = 3;
    } 
```
It is therefore not possible to write to the numElements mapping for any other generations. As they are uninitialized, numElements[i] = 0 when i != 0

Moreover, this numElements mapping is read from when creating a fighter
```solidity
FighterFarm.sol#L458-L474

    /// @notice Creates the base attributes for the fighter.
    /// @param dna The dna of the fighter.
    /// @param fighterType The type of the fighter.
    /// @return Attributes of the new fighter: element, weight, and dna.
    function _createFighterBase(
        uint256 dna, 
        uint8 fighterType
    ) 
        private 
        view 
        returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) 
    {
=>      uint256 element = dna % numElements[generation[fighterType]]; // numElements is 0 when generation[fighterType] != 0.
        uint256 weight = dna % 31 + 65;
        uint256 newDna = fighterType == 0 ? dna : uint256(fighterType);
        return (element, weight, newDna);
    }
```
Therefore if the protocol updates to a new generation of fighters, it will not be able to create anymore new fighters as numElements[generation[fighterType]] will be uninitialized and therefore equal 0. This will cause the transaction to always revert as any modulo by 0 will cause a panic according to Solidity Docs

Modulo with zero causes a Panic error. This check can not be disabled through unchecked { ... }.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Allow the admin to update the numElements mapping when a new generation is created.
