# LRTConfig.sol#updateAssetStrategy function may cause the protocol lose funds and the value of rsETH may fall down.
## Impact
When the manager update the strategy for an asset, the protocol may lose funds deposited already to the previous strategy.
At the same time, the price of rsETH may fall down.

## Proof of Concept
LRTConfig.sol#updateAssetStrategy function is as follows.
```solidity
File: LRTConfig.sol
109:    function updateAssetStrategy(
110:        address asset,
111:        address strategy
112:    )
113:        external
114:        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
115:        onlySupportedAsset(asset)
116:    {
117:        UtilLib.checkNonZeroAddress(strategy);
118:        if (assetStrategy[asset] == strategy) {
119:            revert ValueAlreadyInUse();
120:        }
126:        assetStrategy[asset] = strategy;
127:    }
```
That is, the above function does not check the existence of funds already deposited to the old strategy in the case that the assetStrategy[asset] !== address(0).
Thus, the protocol may not refund assets from the old strategy.
The price of rsETH is determined in the LRTOracle.sol#getRSETHPrice function by the ratio of the total price of assets to the totalSupply() of rsETH.
Therefore, the value of rsETH may fall, depending on the amount of funds deposited to the old strategy.

The example is as follows.

The user A deposits 100eth of asset1 to LRTDepositPool and receive 100eth of rsETH, the user B deposits 100eth of asset2 and receive 100eth of rsETH.
The manager calls updateAssetStrategy and set assetStrategy[asset1] = strategy1.
The manager deposits all of asset1 to strategy1 through NodeDelegator. At this time, the price of rsETH will be getRSETHPrice() == 1 ether.
The manager calls updateAssetStrategy and update to assetStrategy[asset1] = strategy2 and the protocol lose 100eth of asset1.
The price of rsETH will fall down to getRSETHPrice() == 0.5 ether. Thus, at this time, if user C deposits 100eth of asset1 to the deposit pool, he will receive 200eth of rsETH.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify LRTConfig.sol#updateAssetStrategy function to check the existence of funds deposited.
At first, add the followin function to LRTDepositPool.sol.
```solidity
File: interfaces/ILRTDepositPool.sol
21: +    function getTotalAssetStaked(address asset) external view returns (uint256);
File: LRTDepositPool.sol
91: +    function getTotalAssetStaked(address asset)
92: +        external
93: +        view
94: +        onlySupportedAsset(asset)
95: +        returns (uint256 amount)
96: +    {
97: +        uint256 ndcsCount = nodeDelegatorQueue.length;
98: +        for (uint256 i; i < ndcsCount;) {
99: +            amount += INodeDelegator(nodeDelegatorQueue[i]).getAssetBalance(asset);
100: +            unchecked {
101: +                ++i;
102: +            }
103: +        }
104: +    }
```
Next, add the following check to LRTConfig.sol#updateAssetStrategy function.
```solidity
File: LRTConfig.sol
109:    function updateAssetStrategy(
110:        address asset,
111:        address strategy
112:    )
113:        external
114:        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
115:        onlySupportedAsset(asset)
116:    {
117:        UtilLib.checkNonZeroAddress(strategy);
118:        if (assetStrategy[asset] == strategy) {
119:            revert ValueAlreadyInUse();
120:        }
121: +      if (assetStrategy[asset] !== address(0)) {
122: +          address depositPoolAddress = getContract(LRTConstants.LRT_DEPOSIT_POOL);
123: +          require(ILRTDepositPool(depositPoolAddress).getTotalAssetStaked() == 0, 'Please, refund staked assets first');
124: +      }
125:        assetStrategy[asset] = strategy;
126:    }
```
