# Referral fee is calculated wrongly when `spotPurchase`.
## Impact
`referralReward` of `Purchased` event is recored wrongly, so the protocol can suffer.

## Proof of Concept
`SecondSwap_Marketplace.sol#Purchased` event is as follows.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Emitted when a purchase is completed
     * @param vestingPlan Address of the vesting plan contract
     * @param listingId Unique identifier of the listing
     * @param buyer Address of the buyer
     * @param amount Amount of tokens purchased
     * @param referral Address of the referrer
     * @param buyerFee Amount of fees paid by buyer
     * @param sellerFee Amount of fees paid by seller
@>   * @param referralReward Amount of reward paid to referrer
     */
    event Purchased(
        address indexed vestingPlan,
        uint256 indexed listingId,
        address buyer,
        uint256 amount,
        address referral,
        uint256 buyerFee,
        uint256 sellerFee,
@>      uint256 referralReward
    );
```
As we can see, referralReward is the amount of reward paid to referrer.

On the other hand, `SecondSwap_MarketplaceSetting.sol#referralFee` variable is as follows.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Percentage of fees allocated to referrals (in basis points)
     */
    uint256 public referralFee;
```
From `doc`,  `MarketplaceSetting.sol#referralFee` means percentage of fees allocated to referrals.

But `SecondSwap_Marketplace.sol#_handleTransfers()` function is as follows.
```solidity
    function _handleTransfers(
        Listing storage listing,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 discountedPrice,
        uint256 bfee,
        uint256 sfee,
        address _referral
    ) private returns (uint256 buyerFeeTotal, uint256 sellerFeeTotal, uint256 referralFeeCost) {
        ...

        buyerFeeTotal = (baseAmount * bfee) / BASE;
        sellerFeeTotal = (baseAmount * sfee) / BASE;

        ...

        referralFeeCost = 0;
        if (_referral != address(0) && listing.whitelist == address(0)) {
479         referralFeeCost =
480             buyerFeeTotal -
                (baseAmount * bfee * IMarketplaceSetting(marketplaceSetting).referralFee()) /
483             (BASE * BASE);
        }

        ...
    }
```
As you can see above, `referralFeeCost` is calculated with `buyerFeeTotal` substracted by the amount allocated to referral.

And `SecondSwap_Marketplace.sol#spotPurchase()` function is as follows.
```solidity
    function spotPurchase(
        address _vestingPlan,
        uint256 _listingId,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _referral
    ) external isFreeze {
        ...

        // Process all transfers
        (uint256 buyerFeeTotal, uint256 sellerFeeTotal, uint256 referralFeeCost) = _handleTransfers(
            listing,
            _amount,
            discountedPrice,
            bfee,
            sfee,
            _referral
        );

        ...

        // Emit purchase event
        emit Purchased(
            _vestingPlan,
            _listingId,
            msg.sender,
            _amount,
            _referral,
            buyerFeeTotal,
            sellerFeeTotal,
@>          referralFeeCost
        );
    }
```

As we can see, `referralReward` of `Purchased` event is recored wrongly.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
`SecondSwap_Marketplace.sol#_handleTransfers()` function has to be modifed as follows.
```solidity
    function _handleTransfers(
        Listing storage listing,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 discountedPrice,
        uint256 bfee,
        uint256 sfee,
        address _referral
    ) private returns (uint256 buyerFeeTotal, uint256 sellerFeeTotal, uint256 referralFeeCost) {
        ...

        buyerFeeTotal = (baseAmount * bfee) / BASE;
        sellerFeeTotal = (baseAmount * sfee) / BASE;

        ...

        referralFeeCost = 0;
        if (_referral != address(0) && listing.whitelist == address(0)) {
            referralFeeCost =
--              buyerFeeTotal -
                (baseAmount * bfee * IMarketplaceSetting(marketplaceSetting).referralFee()) /
                (BASE * BASE);
        }

        ...
    }
```
