# Incorrect withdraw queue balance in TVL calculation
## Impact
When calculating TVL it iterates over all the operator delegators and inside it iterates over all the collateral tokens. 
```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < odLength; ) {
        ...
        // Iterate through the tokens and get the value of each
        uint256 tokenLength = collateralTokens.length;
        for (uint256 j = 0; j < tokenLength; ) {
            ...
            // record token value of withdraw queue
            if (!withdrawQueueTokenBalanceRecorded) {
                totalWithdrawalQueueValue += renzoOracle.lookupTokenValue(
                    collateralTokens[i],
                    collateralTokens[j].balanceOf(withdrawQueue)
                );
            }
            unchecked {
                ++j;
            }
        }
        ...
        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
```
However, the balance of withdrawQueue is incorrectly fetched, specifically this line:
```solidity
    totalWithdrawalQueueValue += renzoOracle.lookupTokenValue(
        collateralTokens[i],
        collateralTokens[j].balanceOf(withdrawQueue)
    );
```
It uses an incorrect index of the outer loop i to access the collateralTokens. i belongs to the operator delegator index, thus the returned value will not represent the real value of the token. For instance, if there is 1 OD and 3 collateral tokens, it will add the balance of the first token 3 times and neglect the other 2 tokens. If there are more ODs than collateral tokens, the the execution will revert (index out of bounds).

This calculation impacts the TVL which is the essential data when calculating mint/redeem and other critical values. A miscalculation in TVL could have devastating results.

## Proof of Concept
A simplified version of the function to showcase that the same token (in this case address(1)) is emitted multiple times and other tokens are untouched:
```solidity
contract RestakeManager {
    address[] public operatorDelegators;
    address[] public collateralTokens;
    event CollateralTokenLookup(address token);
    constructor() {
        operatorDelegators.push(msg.sender);
        collateralTokens.push(address(1));
        collateralTokens.push(address(2));
        collateralTokens.push(address(3));
    }
    function calculateTVLs() public {
        // Iterate through the ODs
        uint256 odLength = operatorDelegators.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < odLength; ) {
            // Iterate through the tokens and get the value of each
            uint256 tokenLength = collateralTokens.length;
            for (uint256 j = 0; j < tokenLength; ) {
                emit CollateralTokenLookup(collateralTokens[i]);
                unchecked {
                    ++j;
                }
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
