# Lack of slippage and deadline during withdraw and deposit
## Impact
When users call withdraw() to burn their ezETH and receive redemption amount in return, there is no provision to provide any slippage & deadline params. This is necessary because the withdraw() function uses values from the oracle and the users may get a worse rate than they planned for.

Additionally, the withdraw() function also makes use of calls to calculateTVLs() to fetch the current totalTVL. The calculateTVLs() function makes use of oracle prices too. Note that though there is a MAX_TIME_WINDOW inside these oracle lookup functions, the users are forced to rely on this hardcoded value & can’t provide a deadline from their side.
These facts are apart from the consideration that users’ call to withdraw() could very well be unintentionally/intentionally front-run which causes a drop in totalTVL. 

In all of these situations, users receive less than they bargained for and, hence, a slippage and deadline parameter is necessary.

Similar issue can be seen inside deposit() and depositETH().

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Allow users to pass a slippage tolerance value and a deadline parameter while calling these functions.
