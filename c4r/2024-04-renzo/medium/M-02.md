# Deposits will always revert if the amount being deposited is less than the bufferToFill value
## Impact
Severity: Medium. User deposits will always revert if the amount being deposited is less than the bufferToFill value.

Likelihood: High. Depending on the set amount for the withdrawal buffer, this could be a common occurrence.

## Proof of Concept
The deposit function in the RestakeManager contract enables users to deposit ERC20 whitelisted collateral tokens into the protocol. It first checks the withdrawal buffer and fills it up using some or all of the deposited amount if it is below the buffer target. The remaining amount is then transferred to the operator delegator and deposited into EigenLayer.
The current issue with this implementation is that if the amount deposited is less than bufferToFill, the full amount will be used to fill the withdrawal buffer, leaving the amount value as zero.

```solidity
function deposit(IERC20 _collateralToken, uint256 _amount, uint256 _referralId) public nonReentrant notPaused {
        // Verify collateral token is in the list - call will revert if not found
        uint256 tokenIndex = getCollateralTokenIndex(_collateralToken);
	...
        // Check the withdraw buffer and fill if below buffer target
        uint256 bufferToFill = depositQueue.withdrawQueue().getBufferDeficit(address(_collateralToken));
        if (bufferToFill > 0) {
            bufferToFill = (_amount <= bufferToFill) ? _amount : bufferToFill;
            // update amount to send to the operator Delegator
            _amount -= bufferToFill;
            // safe Approve for depositQueue
            _collateralToken.safeApprove(address(depositQueue), bufferToFill);
            // fill Withdraw Buffer via depositQueue
            depositQueue.fillERC20withdrawBuffer(address(_collateralToken), bufferToFill);
        }
        // Approve the tokens to the operator delegator
        _collateralToken.safeApprove(address(operatorDelegator), _amount);
        // Call deposit on the operator delegator
        operatorDelegator.deposit(_collateralToken, _amount);
        ...
    }
```

Subsequently, the function will approve the zero amount to the operator delegator and call deposit on the operator delegator. However, as seen in the OperatorDelegator contractâ€™s deposit function below, a zero deposit will be reverted.

```solidity
  function deposit(IERC20 token, uint256 tokenAmount)
        external
        nonReentrant
        onlyRestakeManager
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        if (address(tokenStrategyMapping[token]) == address(0x0) || tokenAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidZeroInput();
        }
        // Move the tokens into this contract
        token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenAmount);
        return _deposit(token, tokenAmount);
    }
```

Severity: Medium. User deposits will always revert if the amount being deposited is less than the bufferToFill value.

Likelihood: High. Depending on the set amount for the withdrawal buffer, this could be a common occurrence.

Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
To address this issue, the deposit function can be modified to only approve the amount to the operator delegator and call deposit on the operator delegator if the amount is greater than zero.
```solidity
    function deposit(IERC20 _collateralToken, uint256 _amount, uint256 _referralId) public nonReentrant notPaused {
        // Verify collateral token is in the list - call will revert if not found
        uint256 tokenIndex = getCollateralTokenIndex(_collateralToken);
	...
        // Check the withdraw buffer and fill if below buffer target
        uint256 bufferToFill = depositQueue.withdrawQueue().getBufferDeficit(address(_collateralToken));
        if (bufferToFill > 0) {
            bufferToFill = (_amount <= bufferToFill) ? _amount : bufferToFill;
            // update amount to send to the operator Delegator
            _amount -= bufferToFill;
            // safe Approve for depositQueue
            _collateralToken.safeApprove(address(depositQueue), bufferToFill);
            // fill Withdraw Buffer via depositQueue
            depositQueue.fillERC20withdrawBuffer(address(_collateralToken), bufferToFill);
        }
	if (_amount > 0) { // ADD HERE
            // Transfer the tokens to the operator delegator
            _collateralToken.safeApprove(address(operatorDelegator), _amount);
            // Call deposit on the operator delegator
            operatorDelegator.deposit(_collateralToken, _amount);
        }
        ...
    }
```
