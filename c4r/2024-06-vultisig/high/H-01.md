# Vultisig whitelisting can be bypassed by anyone
## Impact
Whitelist launch will be bricked. Anyone can buy tokens, and also bypass the 3 ETH limit by buying via other non-whitelisted accounts. This will have an impact on price and ruin the opportunities of legit whitelisted users.

Here's a diagram on the timelines of the launch. "WL Launch" is the affected phase.

The checkWhitelist() function makes an erroneous check here:
```solidity
    if (_allowedWhitelistIndex == 0 || _whitelistIndex[to] > _allowedWhitelistIndex) {
        revert NotWhitelisted();
    }
```

_allowedWhitelistIndex is the max index allowed, and works as a limit, not a whitelist flag. Once it is set (which must happen for all whitelists), any non-whitelisted user can bypass it.

This is because _whitelistIndex[to] will be 0, and _whitelistIndex[to] > _allowedWhitelistIndex will never revert (0 > 1000 for example).

## Proof of Concept
Add this test to /2024-06-vultisig/hardhat-vultisig/test/unit/Whitelist.ts
Run the test npx hardhat test
```javascript
it.only("Bypasses whitelisting", async function () {
    const { owner, whitelist, pool, otherAccount, mockOracleSuccess, mockContract } = await loadFixture(deployWhitelistFixture);

    await whitelist.setVultisig(mockContract);
    await whitelist.setLocked(false);
    await whitelist.setOracle(mockOracleSuccess);

    // `otherAccount` is not whitelisted and can't bypass the whitelist check
    await expect(whitelist.connect(mockContract).checkWhitelist(pool, otherAccount, 0)).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(
    whitelist,
    "NotWhitelisted",
    );

    // Until an `_allowedWhitelistIndex` limit is set
    // This value is intended as a limit, not as a flag not allow non-whitelisted users
    await whitelist.setAllowedWhitelistIndex(10);

    // `otherAccount` and any other user can now bypass the whitelisting
    await whitelist.connect(mockContract).checkWhitelist(pool, otherAccount, 0);
});
```

Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Prevent non-whitelisted users to bypass the whitelist:
```solidity
-   if (_allowedWhitelistIndex == 0 || _whitelistIndex[to] > _allowedWhitelistIndex) {
+   if (_whitelistIndex[to] == 0 || _whitelistIndex[to] > _allowedWhitelistIndex) {
        revert NotWhitelisted();
    }
```
