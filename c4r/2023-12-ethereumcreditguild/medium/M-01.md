# When a term is offboarded but not cleaned up and then it is onboarded again, an attacker can offboard it freely.
## Impact
When a term is offboarded but not cleaned up and then it is onboarded again, any user who don't have any weight can propose and offboard it freely without passing supporting process.

## Proof of Concept
We say that a term is offboarded.
```solidity
    function offboard(address term) external whenNotPaused {
        require(canOffboard[term], "LendingTermOffboarding: quorum not met");

        // update protocol config
        // this will revert if the term has already been offboarded
        // through another mean.
        GuildToken(guildToken).removeGauge(term);

        // pause psm redemptions
        if (
            nOffboardingsInProgress++ == 0 &&
            !SimplePSM(psm).redemptionsPaused()
        ) {
            SimplePSM(psm).setRedemptionsPaused(true);
        }

        emit Offboard(block.timestamp, term);
    }
```
Then canOffboard[term] == true.
Because of some reasons, for example issuance not repayed, it remains not cleaned up and then it can be onboarded again.
At this time, any user can propose it in offboarding. Then polls[block.number][term] is smaller than quorum but canOffboard[term] == true.
So any user can offboard it immediately.
```solidity
    function proposeOffboard(address term) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            polls[block.number][term] == 0,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: poll exists"
        );
        require(
            block.number > lastPollBlock[term] + POLL_DURATION_BLOCKS,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: poll active"
        );
        // Check that the term is an active gauge
        require(
            GuildToken(guildToken).isGauge(term),
            "LendingTermOffboarding: not an active term"
        );

        polls[block.number][term] = 1; // voting power
        lastPollBlock[term] = block.number;
        emit OffboardSupport(
            block.timestamp,
            term,
            block.number,
            address(0),
            1
        );
    }
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
LendingTermOffboarding.sol#proposeOffboard function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function proposeOffboard(address term) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            polls[block.number][term] == 0,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: poll exists"
        );
        require(
            block.number > lastPollBlock[term] + POLL_DURATION_BLOCKS,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: poll active"
        );
        // Check that the term is an active gauge
        require(
            GuildToken(guildToken).isGauge(term),
            "LendingTermOffboarding: not an active term"
        );

        polls[block.number][term] = 1; // voting power
        lastPollBlock[term] = block.number;
+       canOffboard[term] = false;

        emit OffboardSupport(
            block.timestamp,
            term,
            block.number,
            address(0),
            1
        );
    }
```
