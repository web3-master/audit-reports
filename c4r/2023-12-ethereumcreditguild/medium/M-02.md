# An attacker can clean up a term more than twice, so he can redeem funds maliciously and a legitimate term can become impossible to be cleaned up.
## Impact
An attacker can clean up a term more than twice by using little amount of guildToken and can release redeemption-paused flag, so he can redeem funds maliciously and a legitimate term can become impossible to be cleaned up because of mismatching of offboard and cleanup count.

## Proof of Concept
Through LendingTermOffboarding.sol#proposeOffboard -> supportOffboard -> offboard -> cleanup, a term has been just cleaned up. So we can say that canOffboard[term] == false and polls[snapshotBlock][term] >= quorum.
And we say still block.number <= snapshotBlock + POLL_DURATION_BLOCKS.
Then, an attacker who owned 1 vote of guildToken calls supportOffboard function.
```solidity
    function supportOffboard(
        uint256 snapshotBlock,
        address term
    ) external whenNotPaused {
120     require(
            block.number <= snapshotBlock + POLL_DURATION_BLOCKS,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: poll expired"
        );
        uint256 _weight = polls[snapshotBlock][term];
125     require(_weight != 0, "LendingTermOffboarding: poll not found");
        uint256 userWeight = GuildToken(guildToken).getPastVotes(
            msg.sender,
            snapshotBlock
        );
130     require(userWeight != 0, "LendingTermOffboarding: zero weight");
131     require(
            userPollVotes[msg.sender][snapshotBlock][term] == 0,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: already voted"
        );

        userPollVotes[msg.sender][snapshotBlock][term] = userWeight;
        polls[snapshotBlock][term] = _weight + userWeight;
138     if (_weight + userWeight >= quorum) {
139         canOffboard[term] = true;
        }
        emit OffboardSupport(
            block.timestamp,
            term,
            snapshotBlock,
            msg.sender,
            userWeight
        );
    }
```
As we can see above, the attacker's call isn't reverted on L120, 125, 130, 131.
And on L138 _weight + userWeight > quorum and canOffboard[term] becomes true again.
And then the attacker calls cleanup function.
```solidity
    function cleanup(address term) external whenNotPaused {
176     require(canOffboard[term], "LendingTermOffboarding: quorum not met");
        require(
177         LendingTerm(term).issuance() == 0,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: not all loans closed"
        );
        require(
182         GuildToken(guildToken).isDeprecatedGauge(term),
            "LendingTermOffboarding: re-onboarded"
        );

        // update protocol config
        core().revokeRole(CoreRoles.RATE_LIMITED_CREDIT_MINTER, term);
        core().revokeRole(CoreRoles.GAUGE_PNL_NOTIFIER, term);

        // unpause psm redemptions
        if (
192         --nOffboardingsInProgress == 0 && SimplePSM(psm).redemptionsPaused()
        ) {
194         SimplePSM(psm).setRedemptionsPaused(false);
        }

        canOffboard[term] = false;
        emit Cleanup(block.timestamp, term);
    }
```
L176 isn't reverted and if we assume that all loans are closed L177 isn't reverted as well.
And the term has been already removed on L177 of offboard function, so L182 is not reverted.
```solidity
    function offboard(address term) external whenNotPaused {
        require(canOffboard[term], "LendingTermOffboarding: quorum not met");

        // update protocol config
        // this will revert if the term has already been offboarded
        // through another mean.
159     GuildToken(guildToken).removeGauge(term);

        // pause psm redemptions
        if (
            nOffboardingsInProgress++ == 0 &&
            !SimplePSM(psm).redemptionsPaused()
        ) {
            SimplePSM(psm).setRedemptionsPaused(true);
        }

        emit Offboard(block.timestamp, term);
    }
```
Therefore, L192 is run. If only one term is remained in state of offboard, --nOffboardingProgress == 0
and L192 is run. Then redeemption-paused state is released.
On the other hand, the remained legitimate term becomes impossible to be cleaned up because L192 is reverted because of underflow.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
LendingTermOffboarding.sol#supportOffboard function has to be rewritten as follows.
```solidity
    function supportOffboard(
        uint256 snapshotBlock,
        address term
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        require(
            block.number <= snapshotBlock + POLL_DURATION_BLOCKS,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: poll expired"
        );
        
+       // Check that the term is an active gauge
+       require(
+           GuildToken(guildToken).isGauge(term),
+           "LendingTermOffboarding: not an active term"
+       );

        uint256 _weight = polls[snapshotBlock][term];
        require(_weight != 0, "LendingTermOffboarding: poll not found");
        uint256 userWeight = GuildToken(guildToken).getPastVotes(
            msg.sender,
            snapshotBlock
        );
        require(userWeight != 0, "LendingTermOffboarding: zero weight");
        require(
            userPollVotes[msg.sender][snapshotBlock][term] == 0,
            "LendingTermOffboarding: already voted"
        );

        userPollVotes[msg.sender][snapshotBlock][term] = userWeight;
        polls[snapshotBlock][term] = _weight + userWeight;
        if (_weight + userWeight >= quorum) {
            canOffboard[term] = true;
        }
        emit OffboardSupport(
            block.timestamp,
            term,
            snapshotBlock,
            msg.sender,
            userWeight
        );
    }
```
