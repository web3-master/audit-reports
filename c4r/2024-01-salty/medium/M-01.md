# THE USER WHO WITHDRAWS LIQUIDITY FROM A PARTICULAR POOL IS ABLE TO CLAIM MORE REWARDS THAN HE DULY DESERVES BY CAREFULLY SELECTING A decreaseShareAmount VALUE SUCH THAT THE virtualRewardsToRemove IS ROUNDED DOWN TO ZERO
## Impact
The StakingRewards._decreaseUserShare function is used to decrease a user's share for the pool and have any pending rewards sent to them. When the amount of pending rewards are calculated, initially the virtualRewardsToRemove are calculated as follows:
```solidity
	uint256 virtualRewardsToRemove = (user.virtualRewards * decreaseShareAmount) / user.userShare;
```
Then the virtualRewardsToRemove is substracted from the rewardsForAmount value to calculate the claimableRewards amount as shown below:
```solidity
	if ( virtualRewardsToRemove < rewardsForAmount )
		claimableRewards = rewardsForAmount - virtualRewardsToRemove; 
```
But the issue here is that the virtualRewardsToRemove calculation is rounded down in favor of the user and not in the favor of the protocol. Since the virtualRewardsToRemove is rounded down there is an opportunity to the user to call the StakingRewards._decreaseUserShare function with a very small decreaseShareAmount value such that the virtualRewardsToRemove will be rounded down to 0. Providing a very small decreaseShareAmount value is possible since only input validation on decreaseShareAmount is ! = 0 as shown below:
```solidity
	require( decreaseShareAmount != 0, "Cannot decrease zero share" );
```
When the claimableRewards is calculated it will be equal to the rewardsForAmount value since the virtualRewardsToRemove will be 0. This way the user can keep on removing his liquidity from a particular pool by withdrawing small decreaseShareAmount at a time such that keeping virtualRewardsToRemove at 0 due to rounding down.

Furthermore the decreaseShareAmount value should be selected in such a way rewardsForAmount is calculated to a considerable amount after round down (not zero) and the virtualRewardsToRemove should round down to zero.

Hence as a result the user can withdraw all the rewardsForAmount as the claimableRewards even though some of those rewards are virtual rewards which should not be claimable as clearly stated by the following natspec comment:

	// Some of the rewardsForAmount are actually virtualRewards and can't be claimed.
Hence as a result the user is able to get an undue advantage and claim more rewards for his liquidity during liquidity withdrawable. This happens because the user can bypass the virtual reward subtraction by making it round down to 0. As a result the virtualReward amount of the rewardsForAmount, which should not be claimable is also claimed by the user unfairly.

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
		// Determine the share of the rewards for the amountToDecrease (will include previously added virtual rewards)
		uint256 rewardsForAmount = ( totalRewards[poolID] * decreaseShareAmount ) / totalShares[poolID];

		// For the amountToDecrease determine the proportion of virtualRewards (proportional to all virtualRewards for the user)
		// Round virtualRewards down in favor of the protocol
		uint256 virtualRewardsToRemove = (user.virtualRewards * decreaseShareAmount) / user.userShare;
```

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Hence it is recommended to round up the virtualRewardsToRemove value during its calculation such that it will not be rounded down to zero for a very small decreaseShareAmount. This way user is unable to claim the rewards which he is not eligible for and the rewards will be claimed after accounting for the virtual rewards.
