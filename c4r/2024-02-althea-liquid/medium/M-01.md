# Distribution can be bricked, and double claims by a few holders are possible when owner calls LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s
## Impact
Double claim, DOS by bricking distribution, few holders can lose some rewards due to missing validation of distribution timing when owner calling LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s.
```solidity
    function setDistributableERC20s(
        address[] memory _distributableERC20s
    ) public onlyOwner {
        distributableERC20s = _distributableERC20s;
    }
```
This issue will be impact on following ways :

when a new token is accepted by any nft it should be added as a desirable token, or a new managerNFT with a new token, then also LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s  has to be called to distribute the rewards.
so when owner calls LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s which adds a new token as desired token,

Bricking distrubution to holders: Check the POC for proof
     when a new token is added, we can expect revert when
    - the number of desirable tokens length array is increased
    - an attacker can frontrun and distribute to only one holder , so erc20EntitlementPerUnit is now  changed
    - Now the actual owner tx is processed, which increases/decreases the size of distributableERC20s array.
    - But now distribution is not possible because the Out of Bound revert on the distribution function because distributableERC20s array is changed, but erc20EntitlementPerUnit array size is same before the distributableERC20s array is modified.
```solidity
            for (uint j = 0; j < distributableERC20s.length; j++) {
                uint256 entitlement = erc20EntitlementPerUnit[j] *  this.balanceOf(recipient);
                if (IERC20(distributableERC20s[j]).transfer(recipient, entitlement)) {
                    receipts[j] = entitlement;
                }
            }
```

Double claim by a holder:  so some holder can DOS by
    - A last holder of the 10 holders array frontrun  this owner tx (setDistributableERC20s) and calls LiquidInfrastructureERC20::distribute with 90% of the holders count as params, so all the rewards of old desirable tokens will be distributed to 9 holders.
    - Now after the owners action, backrun it to distribute to the last holder, which will also receive new token as rewards.
    - The previous holders can also claim their share in the next distribution round, but the last holder also can claim which makes double claim possible, which takes a cut from all other holders.

if owner calls LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s which removes some token, then any token balance in the contract will be lost until the owner re-adds the token, and it can be distributed again.

All the issues can be countered if the LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s is validated to make changes happen only after any potential distributions

## Proof of Concept
The logs of the POC shows the revert Index out of bounds

First run forge init --force then run forge i openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v4.3.1 and modify foundry.toml file into below
```solidity

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify LiquidInfrastructureERC20::setDistributableERC20s to only change the desirable tokens after a potential distribution for fair reward sharing.
```solidity
    function setDistributableERC20s(
        address[] memory _distributableERC20s
    ) public onlyOwner {
+       require(!_isPastMinDistributionPeriod(), "set only just after distribution");
        distributableERC20s = _distributableERC20s;
    }
```
