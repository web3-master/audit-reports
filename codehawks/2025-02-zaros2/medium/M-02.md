# Refund Underflow in Swap Refund Logic Leading to Locked Funds
### Summary and Impact

The vulnerability lies in the refund logic within the `refundSwap` function in the `StabilityBranch.sol` contract. In this function, the code subtracts a configured base fee (`baseFeeUsd`) from the user’s deposited amount (`amountIn`) without verifying that the deposit is at least equal to the fee. When a user creates a swap request with an `amountIn` lower than the `baseFeeUsd`, the subtraction underflows. As Solidity 0.8+ performs automatic overflow/underflow checks, the underflow triggers a revert, leaving the swap request unprocessed and the user’s funds permanently locked in the contract.

**Impact**:

* **User Funds Locked**: Users depositing amounts smaller than the base fee cannot reclaim their funds.
* **Denial of Service**: This issue could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service for low–value swap requests.
* **Protocol Invariants**: The flaw violates the expected invariant that every swap request should eventually be either completed or refunded. Instead, underflow conditions cause the request to remain unresolved.

The flaw is significant because it directly conflicts with the protocol’s expectation that all user deposits are either executed or safely returned. In this case, the refund calculation fails, thereby trapping user funds and undermining confidence in the swap functionality.

### Vulnerability Details

* **Description**:\
  In the `refundSwap` function, the contract attempts to calculate the refund by subtracting the base fee from the deposited amount:
  ```solidity
  uint256 refundAmountUsd = depositedUsdToken - baseFeeUsd;
  ```
  If `depositedUsdToken` (i.e. `amountIn`) is less than `baseFeeUsd`, the subtraction underflows, triggering a revert due to Solidity’s built-in overflow/underflow protection. Consequently, the swap request remains unprocessed and the user’s funds are trapped indefinitely.

* **Code Snippet**:



The problematic portion of the code in `StabilityBranch.sol` is as follows:

```solidity
  function refundSwap(uint128 requestId, address engine) external {
      // load swap data
      UsdTokenSwapConfig.Data storage tokenSwapData = UsdTokenSwapConfig.load();

      // load swap request
      UsdTokenSwapConfig.SwapRequest storage request = tokenSwapData.swapRequests[msg.sender][requestId];

      // if request already procesed revert
      if (request.processed) {
          revert Errors.RequestAlreadyProcessed(msg.sender, requestId);
      }

      // if dealine has not yet passed revert
      uint120 deadlineCache = request.deadline;
      if (deadlineCache > block.timestamp) {
          revert Errors.RequestNotExpired(msg.sender, requestId);
      }

      // set precessed to true
      request.processed = true;

      // load Market making engine config
      MarketMakingEngineConfiguration.Data storage marketMakingEngineConfiguration =
          MarketMakingEngineConfiguration.load();

      // get usd token for engine
      address usdToken = marketMakingEngineConfiguration.usdTokenOfEngine[engine];

      // cache the usd token swap base fee
      uint256 baseFeeUsd = tokenSwapData.baseFeeUsd;

      // cache the amount of usd token previously deposited
      uint128 depositedUsdToken = request.amountIn;

      // transfer base fee too protocol fee recipients
      marketMakingEngineConfiguration.distributeProtocolAssetReward(usdToken, baseFeeUsd);

      // cache the amount of usd tokens to be refunded
      uint256 refundAmountUsd = depositedUsdToken - baseFeeUsd;

      // transfer usd refund amount back to user
      IERC20(usdToken).safeTransfer(msg.sender, refundAmountUsd);

      emit LogRefundSwap(
          msg.sender,
          requestId,
          request.vaultId,
          depositedUsdToken,
          request.minAmountOut,
          request.assetOut,
          deadlineCache,
          baseFeeUsd,
          refundAmountUsd
      );
  }
```

* **Test Code Snippet**:\
  Below is an excerpt from the Foundry test case that demonstrates the issue:
  ```solidity
  // Simulate a swap request with amountIn = 50 (less than baseFeeUsd = 100)
  _setSwapRequest(user, TEST_REQUEST_ID, 50);

  // Expect the refundSwap call to revert due to underflow (50 - 100 underflows)
  vm.prank(user);
  vm.expectRevert();
  mockStability.testRefundSwap(TEST_REQUEST_ID, address(0));
  ```
  This test confirms that if a user submits a swap request with an `amountIn` smaller than the required base fee, the refund calculation underflows and reverts, leaving the funds locked.

* **Technical Walkthrough**:
  1. **Swap Request Creation**: A user submits a swap request with a deposit (`amountIn`) that is less than the configured `baseFeeUsd`.
  2. **Refund Attempt**: When the user (or a system keeper) later attempts to execute `refundSwap`, the contract retrieves the `amountIn` from the swap request.
  3. **Underflow Calculation**: The refund is computed as `amountIn - baseFeeUsd`. If `amountIn` (e.g., 50) is less than `baseFeeUsd` (e.g., 100), the arithmetic underflows.
  4. **Reversion**: Solidity’s checked arithmetic causes the transaction to revert, preventing the refund logic from completing and leaving the swap request unprocessed.
  5. **Result**: The user’s funds remain locked in the contract with no mechanism for recovery.

### Recommendations

**Enforce a Minimum Deposit**:\
At the time of swap request creation, add an invariant check to require that `amountIn >= baseFeeUsd`. This would prevent requests with insufficient deposits from being created in the first place.

```solidity
require(amountIn >= tokenSwapData.baseFeeUsd, "Deposit must be >= base fee");
```
