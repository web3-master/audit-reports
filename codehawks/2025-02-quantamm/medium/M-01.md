# formula Deviation from White Paper and Weighted Pool `performUpdate` unintended revert
## Summary

The White Paper states that there should be no difference in the calculation of scaler and vector values across formulas. Additionally, during the unguarded weights stage, the protocol should allow negative weights, as the guard weight ensures final weights validity.

However, for vector kappa values, the `performUpdate` function reverts when it theoretically should not. While a valid revert for a single `performUpdate` is expected behavior, this particular revert should not be treated as default/valid behavior.

## Vulnerability Details

The White Paper mentions that a strategy can utilize either scalar or vector kappa values. The primary difference lies in implementation complexity, as vector kappa values require an additional `SLOAD` operation and a nested loop for processing.

The same formula is applied for both scaler and vector kappa values, ensuring uniformity in calculations regardless of the type of kappa value used.

The current strategy algorithm supports both short and long positions. However, the additional check in the implementation, as shown in the code below, prevents the weighted pool from functioning with long/short positions if the unguarded weights return negative values after a price change.

## Impact

In the case of vector kappa, the weights are not updated and continue using the old values, which is incorrect given the latest price changes. However, with single kappa, the update proceeds as expected, reflecting the new prices.

## Tools Used

Manual Review, Unit Testing

## Recommendations

It is recommended to remove the check `require(res >= 0, "Invalid weight");` from all currently implemented strategies/algorithms. This change will ensure compatibility with scenarios where unguarded weights may temporarily result in negative values, allowing the system to proceed as intended.
