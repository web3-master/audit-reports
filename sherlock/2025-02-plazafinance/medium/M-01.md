# Rounding error of `redeemAmount` is big.
## Summary
Incorrect calculation of `redeemRate` will cause big error of redeemAmount as a user loses funds when redeem from `Pool`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
- In `Pool.sol:498`, there is calculation of `redeemRate` used for redeemAmount with big error.
```solidity
    // Calculate the redeem rate based on the collateral level and token type
    uint256 redeemRate;
    if (collateralLevel <= COLLATERAL_THRESHOLD) {
      redeemRate = ((tvl * multiplier) / assetSupply);
    } else if (tokenType == TokenType.LEVERAGE) {
498   redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
    } else {
      redeemRate = BOND_TARGET_PRICE * PRECISION;
    }
    
    // Calculate and return the final redeem amount
504 return ((depositAmount * redeemRate).fromBaseUnit(oracleDecimals) / ethPrice) / PRECISION;
```
As we can see on L498, redeemRate is calculated with big rounding error. Average error of redeemRate is `PRECISION / 2 = 0.5e6`.   
This error is expanded by `depositAmount` on L504.


## Impact
Users suffer loss of reserveToken when redeem from Pool because of big rounding error.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`Pool.sol:498` has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
--  redeemRate = ((tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) / assetSupply) * PRECISION;
++  redeemRate = (tvl - (bondSupply * BOND_TARGET_PRICE)) * PRECISION / assetSupply;
```
