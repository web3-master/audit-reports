# Anyone could call depositReward with zero reward to extend the period finish time
## Summary
Anyone could extend the reward finish time, potentially resulting in users receiving fewer rewards than expected within the same time period.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function depositReward can be called by anyone, even with zero rewards, allowing it to be exploited to extend the reward finish time at little cost.
This could result in loss of rewards; for instance, if there are 10 DAI rewards within a 10-day period, a malicious user could extend the finish time on day 5, extending the finish time to the 15th day. Participants would only receive 7.5 DAI by the 10th day.
```solidity
   function depositReward(address _rewardsToken, uint256 reward) external updateReward(address(0)) nonReentrant {
        IERC20(_rewardsToken).safeTransferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), reward);

        // Update vesting accounting for reward (if existing rewards being distributed, increase proportionally).
        if (block.timestamp >= rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish) {
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish.sub(block.timestamp);
            uint256 leftover = remaining.mul(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate);
            rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardRate = reward.add(leftover).div(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        }

        rewardData[_rewardsToken].lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        rewardData[_rewardsToken].periodFinish = block.timestamp.add(rewardData[_rewardsToken].rewardsDuration);
        emit RewardDeposited(_rewardsToken, reward, _msgSender());
    }
```

## Impact
Anyonce could extend the reward finish time and the users may receive less rewards than expected during the same time period.
