# An attacker can increase `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` much bigger without limit causing freeze of borrowing.
## Summary
Missing update of lastEventTime in `borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()` will cause freezing of protocol as an attacker will increase `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` much bigger without limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
- In borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate() function, lastEventTime is not updated.
```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
As you can see above, calculateCumulativeRate() function is public.


## Impact
Protocol can be frozen by an attacker.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate()` function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
        uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
            lastEventTime,
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
++      lastEventTime = block.timestamp;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```
