# The `borrowing.lastCumulateRate` is updated wrongly when withdrawal from borrowing.
## Summary
Wrong calculation of `borrowing.lastCumulativeRate` will cause less debt of borrower leading to loss of protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
- In borrowing.sol#_withdraw() function, lastCumulativeRate is updated after lastEventTime is updated.
```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        ...

        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
@>      lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
@>      calculateCumulativeRate();

        ...
    }
```
- In borrowing.sol#calculateCumulativeRate(), lastCumulativeRate is updated from currentTime and lastEventTime.
```solidity
    function calculateCumulativeRate() public returns (uint256) {
        // Get the noOfBorrowers
        uint128 noOfBorrowers = treasury.noOfBorrowers();
        // Call calculateCumulativeRate in borrow library
@>      uint256 currentCumulativeRate = BorrowLib.calculateCumulativeRate(
            noOfBorrowers,
            ratePerSec,
@>          lastEventTime,  @audit: This is same as block.timestamp.
            lastCumulativeRate
        );
        lastCumulativeRate = currentCumulativeRate;
        return currentCumulativeRate;
    }
```

## Impact
Less lastCumulativeRate leads to less debt of borrower. Because of zero-sum, protocol loses.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`borrowing.sol#_withdraw()` function has to be modified as follows.
```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        address toAddress,
        uint64 index,
        bytes memory odosAssembledData,
        uint64 ethPrice,
        uint128 exchangeRate,
        uint64 withdrawTime
    ) internal {
        ...

++      calculateCumulativeRate();
        lastEthprice = uint128(ethPrice);
        lastEventTime = uint128(block.timestamp);}

        // Call calculateCumulativeRate function to get the interest
--      calculateCumulativeRate();

        ...
    }
```
