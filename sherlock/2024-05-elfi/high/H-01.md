# updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin function mistakenly increments positions "fromBalance"
## Summary
When a position is closed all the other positions "from balances" are updated. However, the function logic updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin is not fully correct and can increment the "from balances" of other positions more than it supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume Bob has 3 positions as follows:
WBTC SHORT 1000$ margin 5x (BTC price 25k)
WETH SHORT 500$ margin 5x (ETH price 1k)
SOL SHORT 1000$ margin 5x (SOL price 10$)

Also, Bob has the following balances in his cross account:
USDC:
balance.amount = 1000
WBTC:
balance.amount = 1

Bob first opens up the WBTC short and since the marginToken is USDC all the balance he has in his account will be used. Hence, this position will have the same initialMargin amount as its initialMarginFromBalance.

When Bob opens the SOL and WETH shorts the initialMarginFromBalance for them will be "0" since the first WBTC short occupied all the available USDC.

At some time later, assume the BTC price goes to 23K. Bob opened the short position from 25k and assuming fees are not more than the profit bob has profits. Say Bob's settled margin after closing this position is 1381 USDC (actual amount from the PoC) which means there is a profit of 381$ for Bob.

Below code snippet in DecreasePosition::_settleCrossAccount() will be calculating the changeToken which since the entire position is closed the value for it will be the settle margin, 1381 USDC.
```solidity
 if (!cache.isLiquidation) {
            int256 changeToken = (
                cache.decreaseMarginInUsdFromBalance.mul(cache.position.initialMargin).div(
                    cache.position.initialMarginInUsd
                )
            ).toInt256() +
                cache.settledMargin -
                cache.decreaseMargin.toInt256();
            PositionMarginProcess.updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin(
                requestId,
                accountProps.owner,
                cache.position.marginToken,
                changeToken,
                position.key
            );
        }
```
Below code snippet in PositionMarginProcess::updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin() function will start incrementing the "from balance"s of the other remaining SOL and WETH positions. As we can see updatePositionFromBalanceMargin always gets the initial amount as function variable which remember it was the settle margin amount.
```solidity
bytes32[] memory positionKeys = Account.load(account).getAllPosition();
        int256 reduceAmount = amount;
        for (uint256 i; i < positionKeys.length; i++) {
            Position.Props storage position = Position.load(positionKeys[i]);
            if (token == position.marginToken && position.isCrossMargin) {
                int256 changeAmount = updatePositionFromBalanceMargin(
                    position,
                    originPositionKey.length > 0 && originPositionKey == position.key,
                    requestId,
                    amount
                ).toInt256();
                reduceAmount = amount > 0 ? reduceAmount - changeAmount : reduceAmount + changeAmount;
                if (reduceAmount == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
```
Below code snippet in PositionMarginProcess::updatePositionFromBalanceMargin() will be executed for both SOL and WETH positions. Assume WETH is the first in the position keys line, changeAmount will be calculated as the borrowMargin because of the min operation and position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance will be increased by the position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance which is 500$. When the execution ends here and we go back to the above code snippets for loop for the SOL position, the reduceAmount will be decreased by 500$ and will be 1381 - 500 = 881$.
However, when the updatePositionFromBalanceMargin function called for the SOL position the amount is still 1381 USDC. Hence, the return value for the function will be again the borrowMargin which is 1000$. When we go back to the loop we will update the decreaseAmount as 881 - 1000 = -119 and the loop ends because we looped over all the positions (no underflow since reduceAmount is int256). However, what happened here is that although the reduceAmount was lower than what needed to be increased for the positions "from balance" the full amount increased. Which is completely wrong and now the accounts overall "from balance"s are completely wrong as well.
```solidity
if (amount > 0) {
            // @review how much I am borrowing
            uint256 borrowMargin = (position.initialMarginInUsd - position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance)
                .mul(position.initialMargin)
                .div(position.initialMarginInUsd);
            changeAmount = amount.toUint256().min(borrowMargin);
            position.initialMarginInUsdFromBalance += changeAmount.mul(position.initialMarginInUsd).div(
                position.initialMargin
            );
        }
```

## Impact
Cross accounts values will be completely off. Cross available value will be a lower number than it should be.
Also, the opposite scenario can happen which would make the account has more borrowing power than it should be.
Hence, high.

## Recommendation
Do the following for the updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin function
```solidity
function updateAllPositionFromBalanceMargin(
        uint256 requestId,
        address account,
        address token,
        int256 amount,
        bytes32 originPositionKey
    ) external {
        if (amount == 0) {
            return;
        }

        bytes32[] memory positionKeys = Account.load(account).getAllPosition();
        int256 reduceAmount = amount;
        for (uint256 i; i < positionKeys.length; i++) {
            Position.Props storage position = Position.load(positionKeys[i]);
            if (token == position.marginToken && position.isCrossMargin) {
                int256 changeAmount = updatePositionFromBalanceMargin(
                    position,
                    originPositionKey.length > 0 && originPositionKey == position.key,
                    requestId,
 -                 amount
 +                reduceAmount
                ).toInt256();
                reduceAmount = amount > 0 ? reduceAmount - changeAmount : reduceAmount + changeAmount;
                if (reduceAmount == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
