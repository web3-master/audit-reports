# User Collateral Cap Check Issue
## Summary
User Collateral can exceeds the cap andd deposit will still be processed

## Vulnerability Detail
The check accountProps.getTokenAmount(token) > tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap is designed to ensure that a user's collateral does not exceed their specific cap. However, this validation occurs before the new deposit amount is added, thereby only verifying the current balance. Consequently, this can result in the user's collateral exceeding the cap once the deposit is processed.

## Impact
this can result in the user's collateral exceeding the cap once the deposit is processed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please find the updated check for the new deposit amount below:
```solidity
uint256 newUserCollateralAmount = accountProps.getTokenAmount(token) + params.amount;
require(newUserCollateralAmount <= tradeTokenConfig.collateralUserCap, "CollateralUserCapOverflow");
```
This modification ensures that the user's total collateral, including the new deposit, does not exceed the predefined user cap.
