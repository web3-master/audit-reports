# Beneficiary will lose unclaimed fees.
## Summary
If `BaseImplementation.setBeneficiary()` sets new beneficiary which is a Flayer pool, old beneficiary can not claim the unclaimed fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
`BaseImplementation.setBeneficiary()` function is following.
```solidity
    /**
     * Allows our beneficiary address to be updated, changing the address that will
@>   * be allocated fees moving forward. The old beneficiary will still have access
     * to `claim` any fees that were generated whilst they were set.
     *
     * @param _beneficiary The new fee beneficiary
     * @param _isPool If the beneficiary is a Flayer pool
     */
    function setBeneficiary(address _beneficiary, bool _isPool) public onlyOwner {
        beneficiary = _beneficiary;
        beneficiaryIsPool = _isPool;

        // If we are setting the beneficiary to be a Flayer pool, then we want to
        // run some additional logic to confirm that this is a valid pool by checking
        // if we can match it to a corresponding {CollectionToken}.
        if (_isPool && address(locker.collectionToken(_beneficiary)) == address(0)) {
            revert BeneficiaryIsNotPool();
        }

        emit BeneficiaryUpdated(_beneficiary, _isPool);
    }
```
As can be seen, the comment of the above function says that "The old beneficiary will still have access to `claim` any fees that were generated whilst they were set.". However, if `_isPool` parameter is `true`, `beneficiaryIsPool` state variable will be set as `true`. Therefore, after that, the following `BaseImplementation.claim()` function will revert in `L171` for old beneficiary.
```solidity
    function claim(address _beneficiary) public nonReentrant {
        // Ensure that the beneficiary has an amount available to claim. We don't revert
        // at this point as it could open an external protocol to DoS.
        uint amount = beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary];
        if (amount == 0) return;

        // We cannot make a direct claim if the beneficiary is a pool
171:    if (beneficiaryIsPool) revert BeneficiaryPoolCannotClaim();

        // Reduce the amount of fees allocated to the `beneficiary` for the token. This
        // helps to prevent reentrancy attacks.
        beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] = 0;

        // Claim ETH equivalent available to the beneficiary
        IERC20(nativeToken).transfer(_beneficiary, amount);
        emit BeneficiaryFeesClaimed(_beneficiary, amount);
    }
``` 

## Impact
The comment "The old beneficiary will still have access to `claim` any fees that were generated whilst they were set." means that admin may not call `claim()` function for old beneficiary before calling `setBeneficiary()` function. By Sherlock rule, the code comments stands above all judging rules. Therefore, the old beneficiary may lose the unclaimed fees. Lock of Funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Insert the following condition check in `BaseImplementation.setBeneficiary()` function.
```solidity
    if (_isPool && beneficiaryFees[_beneficiary] > 0) {
        revert;
    }
```
Or, fix the comment as the following.
```
Admin should call `claim()` function for old beneficiary before calling `setBeneficiary()` function when `_isPool` is true.
