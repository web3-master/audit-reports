# Attacker can disable `CollectionShutdown.preventShutdown()` function.
## Summary
The protocol has function of preventing shudown for a certain collection by admin.
However, attacker can start shutdown by calling `CollectionShutdown.start()` function with only 1 wei before admin calls `CollectionShutdown.preventShutdown()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following `CollectionShutdown.preventShudown()` function will revert if shutdown is already in progress.
```solidity
    function preventShutdown(address _collection, bool _prevent) public {
        // Make sure our user is a locker manager
        if (!locker.lockerManager().isManager(msg.sender)) revert ILocker.CallerIsNotManager();

        // Make sure that there isn't currently a shutdown in progress
@>      if (_collectionParams[_collection].shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();

        // Update the shutdown to be prevented
        shutdownPrevented[_collection] = _prevent;
        emit CollectionShutdownPrevention(_collection, _prevent);
    }
```
On the other hand, the following `CollectionShutdown.start()` function can be called and succeeded before the collection is initialized by `Locker.initializeCollection()` function.
```solidity
    function start(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Confirm that this collection is not prevented from being shutdown
        if (shutdownPrevented[_collection]) revert ShutdownPrevented();

        // Ensure that a shutdown process is not already actioned
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.shutdownVotes != 0) revert ShutdownProcessAlreadyStarted();

        // Get the total number of tokens still in circulation, specifying a maximum number
        // of tokens that can be present in a "dormant" collection.
        params.collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);
        uint totalSupply = params.collectionToken.totalSupply();
147:    if (totalSupply > MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** params.collectionToken.denomination()) revert TooManyItems();

        // Set our quorum vote requirement
        params.quorumVotes = uint88(totalSupply * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT);

        // Notify that we are processing a shutdown
        emit CollectionShutdownStarted(_collection);

        // Cast our vote from the user
156:    _collectionParams[_collection] = _vote(_collection, params);
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function doesn't check if collection is already initialized and the condition of `L147` will be true because collection is not initialized yet.
In addition, `_vote()` function of `L156` requires `msg.sender` should hold non-zero `collectionToken`s.

From above reasoning, the following scenario is available.
1. Admin create collection by calling `Locker.createCollection()` function.
2. Before admin initialize the collection by calling `Locker.initializeCollection()` function, using frontrun, attacker deposit 1 NFT and receive corresponding `collectionToken`s.
3. Attacker(`attackerAddress1`) transfer `1 wei` `collectionToken` to some other `attackerAddress2`.
4. Attacker(`attackerAddress2`) start shutdown by calling `CollectionShutdown.start()` function. It will succeed because number of deposited NFT is only one which is less than `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS = 4`.
5. After that, admin can't prevent shutdown for the collection by calling `CollectionShutdown.preventShutdown()` function because there is already a shutdown in progress.

## Impact
Comment of `CollectionShutdown.start()` function has following paragraph:
```solidity
     * When the trigger is set, it will only be available for a set duration.
     * If this duration passes, then the process will need to start again.
```
But in fact, there is no such restriction in the current implementation.
Therefore, once if a shutdown is in progress, it will be available for unlimited time and the `preventShutdown()` function will be DOSed for unlimited time too.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disable the `CollectionShutdown.start()` function before collection is initialized.
