# `TaxCalculator.calculateCompoundedFactor()` function inflate the compounded factor by 10 times.
## Summary
`TaxCalculator.calculateCompoundedFactor()` function inflate the compounded factor by 10 times.

## Vulnerability Detail
`TaxCalculator.calculateCompoundedFactor()` function is the following.
```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
82:     uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
90:     compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
    }
```
The `calculateProtectedInterest()` function of `L82` is following. 
```solidity
    /**
     * Calculates the interest rate for Protected Listings based on the utilization rate
     * for the collection.
     *
     * This maps to a hockey puck style chart, with a slow increase until we reach our
     * kink, which will subsequently rapidly increase the interest rate.
     *
53:  * @dev The interest rate is returned to 2 decimal places (200 = 2%)
     *
     * @param _utilizationRate The utilization rate for the collection
     *
     * @return interestRate_ The annual interest rate for the collection
     */
    function calculateProtectedInterest(uint _utilizationRate) public pure returns (uint interestRate_) {
        // If we haven't reached our kink, then we can just return the base fee
        if (_utilizationRate <= UTILIZATION_KINK) {
            // Calculate percentage increase for input range 0 to 0.8 ether (2% to 8%)
            interestRate_ = 200 + (_utilizationRate * 600) / UTILIZATION_KINK;
        }
        // If we have passed our kink value, then we need to calculate our additional fee
        else {
            // Convert value in the range 0.8 to 1 to the respective percentage between 8% and
            // 100% and make it accurate to 2 decimal places.
            interestRate_ = (((_utilizationRate - UTILIZATION_KINK) * (100 - 8)) / (1 ether - UTILIZATION_KINK) + 8) * 100;
        }
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function returns `10000` for `100%`. It can also be verified in the comments of `L53`. But in `L90`, the function divides the `perSecondRate` by `1000` instead of `10_000`, and thus inflate the compounded factor by 10.

## Impact
Users will pay 10 times more tax than they should. It means Loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Modify `TaxCalculator.calculateCompoundedFactor()` function as below.
```solidity
    function calculateCompoundedFactor(uint _previousCompoundedFactor, uint _utilizationRate, uint _timePeriod) public view returns (uint compoundedFactor_) {
        // Get our interest rate from our utilization rate
        uint interestRate = this.calculateProtectedInterest(_utilizationRate);

        // Ensure we calculate the compounded factor with correct precision. `interestRate` is
        // in basis points per annum with 1e2 precision and we convert the annual rate to per
        // second rate.
        uint perSecondRate = (interestRate * 1e18) / (365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

        // Calculate new compounded factor
--      compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate / 1000 * _timePeriod)) / 1e18;
++      compoundedFactor_ = _previousCompoundedFactor * (1e18 + (perSecondRate * _timePeriod / 10000)) / 1e18;
    }
```
