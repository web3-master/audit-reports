# `Listings.relist()` function doesn't set `listing.created` as `block.timestamp`.
## Summary
`Listings.relist()` function doesn't set `listing.created` as `block.timestamp`.
It causes several serious problems to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Listings.createListings()` function set `listing.created` as `block.timestamp` but the following `Listings.relist()` function doesn't set `listing.created` as `block.timestamp`.
```solidity
    function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        // Load our tokenId
        address _collection = _listing.collection;
        uint _tokenId = _listing.tokenIds[0];

        // Read the existing listing in a single read
        Listing memory oldListing = _listings[_collection][_tokenId];

        // Ensure the caller is not the owner of the listing
        if (oldListing.owner == msg.sender) revert CallerIsAlreadyOwner();

        // Load our new Listing into memory
        Listing memory listing = _listing.listing;

        // Ensure that the existing listing is available
        (bool isAvailable, uint listingPrice) = getListingPrice(_collection, _tokenId);
        if (!isAvailable) revert ListingNotAvailable();

        // We can process a tax refund for the existing listing
        (uint _fees,) = _resolveListingTax(oldListing, _collection, true);
        if (_fees != 0) {
            emit ListingFeeCaptured(_collection, _tokenId, _fees);
        }

        // Find the underlying {CollectionToken} attached to our collection
        ICollectionToken collectionToken = locker.collectionToken(_collection);

        // If the floor multiple of the original listings is different, then this needs
        // to be paid to the original owner of the listing.
        uint listingFloorPrice = 1 ether * 10 ** collectionToken.denomination();
        if (listingPrice > listingFloorPrice) {
            unchecked {
                collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, oldListing.owner, listingPrice - listingFloorPrice);
            }
        }

        // Validate our new listing
        _validateCreateListing(_listing);

        // Store our listing into our Listing mappings
665:    _listings[_collection][_tokenId] = listing;

        // Pay our required taxes
668:    payTaxWithEscrow(address(collectionToken), getListingTaxRequired(listing, _collection), _payTaxWithEscrow);

        // Emit events
        emit ListingRelisted(_collection, _tokenId, listing);
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function doesn't set `_listings[_collection][_tokenId].created` as `block.timestamp` in `L665`. Although the test codes of `Listings.t.sol` are setting `listing.created` as `block.timestamp` when calling `Listings.relist()` function, users can set `listing.created` arbitrarily when calling `Listings.relist()` function. 
Even in the case that user (or frontend) try to set `listing.created` as `block.timestamp`, since the user's tx will be stayed in mempool for unexpected period, `listing.created` will be different with `block.timestamp`. 

If `listing.created` is before than `block.timestamp`, user will lose part of tax required for relisting (which is paid in `L668`). If `listing.created` is much smaller than `block.timestamp`, user's NFT will be auctioned at low price as soon as it is relisted.
If `listing.created` is greater than `block.timestamp`, user's NFT can't be filled for a period from `block.timestamp` to `listing.created`.

## Impact
User will lose the tax required for relisting or user's NFT listing will be auctioned at low price. It means loss of funds.
User's NFT listing can't be filled for a period. It means lock of funds.

## Recommendation
Modify `Listings.relist()` function as below.
```solidity
    function relist(CreateListing calldata _listing, bool _payTaxWithEscrow) public nonReentrant lockerNotPaused {
        --- SKIP ---

        // Load our new Listing into memory
        Listing memory listing = _listing.listing;
++      listing.created = block.timestamp;

        --- SKIP ---
    }
