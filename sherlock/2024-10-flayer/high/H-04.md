# Attacker can lock all ethers after shutdown executed and collection liquidation completed.
## Summary
When there are less than `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` collection NFTs in the protocol, there will be shutdown vote. If totalSupply exceeds `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`, after shutdown executed, attacker can cancel votes and lock all ethers into the contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
At first, the `CollectionShutdown.execute()` function is following.
```solidity
    function execute(address _collection, uint[] calldata _tokenIds) public onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Ensure we have specified token IDs
        uint _tokenIdsLength = _tokenIds.length;
        if (_tokenIdsLength == 0) revert NoNFTsSupplied();

        // Check that no listings currently exist
        if (_hasListings(_collection)) revert ListingsExist();

        // Refresh total supply here to ensure that any assets that were added during
        // the shutdown process can also claim their share.
        uint newQuorum = params.collectionToken.totalSupply() * SHUTDOWN_QUORUM_PERCENT / ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT;
        if (params.quorumVotes != newQuorum) {
            params.quorumVotes = uint88(newQuorum);
        }

        // Lockdown the collection to prevent any new interaction
        locker.sunsetCollection(_collection);

        // Iterate over our token IDs and transfer them to this contract
        IERC721 collection = IERC721(_collection);
        for (uint i; i < _tokenIdsLength; ++i) {
            locker.withdrawToken(_collection, _tokenIds[i], address(this));
        }

        // Approve sudoswap pair factory to use our NFTs
        collection.setApprovalForAll(address(pairFactory), true);

        // Map our collection to a newly created pair
        address pool = _createSudoswapPool(collection, _tokenIds);

        // Set the token IDs that have been sent to our sweeper pool
        params.sweeperPoolTokenIds = _tokenIds;
        sweeperPoolCollection[pool] = _collection;

        // Update our collection parameters with the pool
        params.sweeperPool = pool;

        // Prevent the collection from being executed again
273:    params.canExecute = false;
        emit CollectionShutdownExecuted(_collection, pool, _tokenIds);
    }
```
As can be seen, admin can execute shutdown vote even if totalSupply exceeds `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`. Also, the above function change the `params.canExecute` to `false` in `L273` after shutdown executed.

Next, the `CollectionShutdown._vote()` function is following.
```solidity
    function _vote(address _collection, CollectionShutdownParams memory params) internal returns (CollectionShutdownParams memory) {
        // Take tokens from the user and hold them in this escrow contract
        uint userVotes = params.collectionToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        if (userVotes == 0) revert UserHoldsNoTokens();

        // Pull our tokens in from the user
        params.collectionToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), userVotes);

        // Register the amount of votes sent as a whole, and store them against the user
        params.shutdownVotes += uint96(userVotes);

        // Register the amount of votes for the collection against the user
        unchecked { shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender] += userVotes; }

        emit CollectionShutdownVote(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);

        // If we can execute, then we need to fire another event
        if (!params.canExecute && params.shutdownVotes >= params.quorumVotes) {
209:        params.canExecute = true;
            emit CollectionShutdownQuorumReached(_collection);
        }

        return params;
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function doesn't check if vote has already executed, so attacker can vote using only 1 wei even after vote executed, and can change `params.canExecute` to `true` again in `L209`.
After that, attacker can call `CollectionShutdown.cancel()` function and delete `_collectionParams[_collection]` totally.

PoC:
1. Assume that `denomination` is 1 and totalSupplay of a collection are `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS = 4 ethers`.
2. Shutdown vote starts and the votes can execute since total votes are larger than quorum threshold.
3. TotalSupply increases again and exceeds `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` for some reason.
4. Admin executes shutdown vote and transfer all NFTs of Locker to sweeper pool and swap them to ethers.
5. Attacker votes using only 1 wei collectionToken (which he can buy in uniswap pool) and change `params.canExecute` to `true` again.
6. Attacker calls `CollectionShutdown.cancel()` function and delete `_collectionParams[_collection]` totally.
7. After collection liquidation completed, all protocol users can't claim ethers for their collectionTokens because `_collectionParams[_collection]` is deleted.

## Impact
Attacker can lock all ethers using only 1 wei collectionToken after shutdownn executed and collection liquidation completed.
Here, not only voters but also other users can't claim ethers for their collectionToken holdings.

## Recommendation
Add check if vote has already executed into the `CollectionShutdown._vote()` function.
