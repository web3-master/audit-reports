# Attacker can lock shutdown voters' collectionTokens forever.
## Summary
When there are less than `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS` collection NFTs in the protocol, there will be shutdown vote. When shutdown vote exceeds quorum threshold and can execute, attacker can deposit NFTs to increase totalSupply of collectionTokens and cancel vote. As a result, voters' collectionTokens will be locked forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `CollectionShutdown.cancel()` function is following.
```solidity
    function cancel(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // Ensure that the vote count has reached quorum
        CollectionShutdownParams memory params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (!params.canExecute) revert ShutdownNotReachedQuorum();

        // Check if the total supply has surpassed an amount of the initial required
        // total supply. This would indicate that a collection has grown since the
        // initial shutdown was triggered and could result in an unsuspected liquidation.
        if (params.collectionToken.totalSupply() <= MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS * 10 ** locker.collectionToken(_collection).denomination()) {
            revert InsufficientTotalSupplyToCancel();
        }

        // Remove our execution flag
403:    delete _collectionParams[_collection];
        emit CollectionShutdownCancelled(_collection);
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function deletes the `_collectionParams[_collection]` in `L403` when totalSupply is larger than `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS`.
After shudown vote is canceled, voters should reclaim their votes to refund their voted collectionTokens. However, `CollectionShutdown.reclaimVote()` function is following.
```solidity
    function reclaimVote(address _collection) public whenNotPaused {
        // If the quorum has passed, then we can no longer reclaim as we are pending
        // an execution.
        CollectionShutdownParams storage params = _collectionParams[_collection];
        if (params.canExecute) revert ShutdownQuorumHasPassed();

        // Get the amount of votes that the user has cast for this collection
        uint userVotes = shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // If the user has not cast a vote, then we can revert early
        if (userVotes == 0) revert NoVotesPlacedYet();

        // We delete the votes that the user has attributed to the collection
369:    params.shutdownVotes -= uint96(userVotes);
        delete shutdownVoters[_collection][msg.sender];

        // We can now return their tokens
373:    params.collectionToken.transfer(msg.sender, userVotes);

        // Notify our stalkers that a vote has been reclaimed
        emit CollectionShutdownVoteReclaim(_collection, msg.sender, userVotes);
    }
```
As can be seen, since `_collectionParams[_collection]` has been deleted, the above function will revert at `L369` and `L373`.
As a result, voters' collectionTokens will be locked in the `CollectionShutdown` contract.

PoC:
1. Assume that `denomination` is 1 and totalSupplay of a collection are `MAX_SHUTDOWN_TOKENS = 4 ethers`.
2. Shutdown vote starts and the votes can execute since total votes are larger than quorum threshold.
3. Attacker deposits 1 NFT to the collection and cancel shutdown vote.
4. Voters' collectionTokens will be locked since they can't reclaim their votes.
5. Attacker can redeem his NFT if necessary.

## Impact
Attacker can lock shutdown voters' collectionTokens without any risk and loss.
Since majority amount of collectionTokens are locked, new shutdown vote can't execute again. Therefore, the voters' collectionTokens will be locked forever.

## Recommendation
Add a function to reclaim votes in the case of canceling shutdown vote.
