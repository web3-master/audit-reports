# Borrowers will overpay fees when extending loans.

## Summary
A logical error in the `DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan()` function causes borrowers to always pay the max fee when extending loans, regardless of the acual max deadline of loan offers. This results in borrowers overpaying fees to the protocol.

## Root Cause
- The [DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function has logical error in calculating fees as follows:
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
        ... SKIP ...

                // if user already paid the max fee, then we dont have to charge them again
                if (PorcentageOfFeePaid != maxFee) {
                    // calculate difference from fee paid for the initialDuration vs the extra fee they should pay because of the extras days of extending the loan.  MAXFEE shouldnt be higher than extra fee + PorcentageOfFeePaid
602:                uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
                        86400);
                    if (feeOfMaxDeadline > maxFee) {
605:                    feeOfMaxDeadline = maxFee;
                    } else if (feeOfMaxDeadline < feePerDay) {
                        feeOfMaxDeadline = feePerDay;
                    }

                    misingBorrowFee = feeOfMaxDeadline - PorcentageOfFeePaid;
                }
        ... SKIP ...
    }
```
As can be seen, `L602` uses the absolute `offer.maxDeadline` instead of the remaining time after loan start, making `feeOfMaxDeadline` excessively large. Therefore, `feeOfMaxDeadline` will always exceeds `maxFee` and will be set as `maxFee` in `L605`. As a result, borrowers end up paying maxFee regardless of the actual max deadline.

## Internal pre-conditions

## External pre-conditions

## Attack Path
The default value of `maxFee` is `20 * feePerDay` in the codebase.
1. A borrower takes out a loan with `maxDeadline = block.timestamp + 8 days`.
2. After `5 days` passed, the borrower extends the loan.
3. In this case, the `extendLoan()` function pays fees for `20 days` instead of `8 days`.
4. As a result, the borrower overpay fees for `12 days`.

## Impact
Loss of borrowers' funds because the borrowers overpay fees whenever they extend their loans.

## Mitigation
Modify the `DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan()` function as follows:
```diff
        ... SKIP ...
-               uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline * feePerDay) /
+               uint feeOfMaxDeadline = ((offer.maxDeadline - m_loan.startedAt) * feePerDay /
                        86400);
        ... SKIP ...
```
