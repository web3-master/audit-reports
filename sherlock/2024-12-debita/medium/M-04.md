# Extending loan will revert due to the unused variable.

## Summary
The `DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan()` function has a unused variable `extendedTime`. Extending loan will revert due to the unused variable.

## Root Cause
- The [DebitaV3Loan.extendLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-debita-finance-v3/blob/main/Debita-V3-Contracts/contracts/DebitaV3Loan.sol#L547-L664) function has unused variable `extendedTime`:
```solidity
    function extendLoan() public {
        ... SKIP ...
588:            uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

590:            uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
                    alreadyUsedTime -
                    block.timestamp;
        ... SKIP ...
    }
```
As can be seen, when `block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt` is larger than `offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp`, the function will revert.

## Internal pre-conditions
- More than half of the max deadline passed after the loan started.

## External pre-conditions

## Attack Path
1. A borrower takes out a loan with `maxDeadline = block.timestamp + 10 days`.
2. After `6 days` passed, the borrower attempts to extend the loan.
3. The `extendLoan()` function reverts in `L590`.
4. As a result, the borrower can't extend the loan.

## Impact
Borrowers can't extend their loan.

## PoC
In the attack path:
1. `alreadyUsedTime = 6 days` in `L588`.
2. `L590` will be modified as follows:
```solidity
    extendedTime = (offer.maxDeadline - block.timestamp) - alreadUsedTime;
```
Therefore, since `extendedTime = 4 days - 6 days < 0`, the function reverts.

## Mitigation
Remove the unused variable `extendedTime` as follows.
```diff
    function extendLoan() public {
        ... SKIP ...
                uint alreadyUsedTime = block.timestamp - m_loan.startedAt;

-               uint extendedTime = offer.maxDeadline -
-                   alreadyUsedTime -
-                   block.timestamp;
        ... SKIP ...
    }
```
