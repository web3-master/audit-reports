# Attacker can sell a position which is pending to close.

## Summary
DelayedOrder.sol#announceLeverageClose function lock the position to close.
But an attacker can unlock the locked position by calling LimitOrder.sol#cancelLimitOrder function.
Thus attacker can sell a position which is pending to close.

## Vulnerability Detail
DelayedOrder.sol#announceLeverageClose function is the following.
```solidity
    function announceLeverageClose(uint256 tokenId, uint256 minFillPrice, uint256 keeperFee) external whenNotPaused {
        ......
        // Lock the NFT belonging to this position so that it can't be transferred to someone else.
        // Locking doesn't require an approval from the leverage trader.
        leverageModule.lock(tokenId);
        ......
    }
```
From comment, we can see that the token which is pending to close should not be transferred to someone else.
```solidity
On the other hand, LimitOrder.sol#cancelLimitOrder function is the following.

    function cancelLimitOrder(uint256 tokenId) external {
        ......
        // Unlock the ERC721 position NFT to allow for transfers.
        ILeverageModule(vault.moduleAddress(FlatcoinModuleKeys._LEVERAGE_MODULE_KEY)).unlock(tokenId);
        ......
    }
```
So an attacker can unlock the position which is pending to close and sell it to someone else.

Example:

Suppose that user1(attacker) owns tokenId1 position.
Attacker set tokenId1 as pending to LimitClose by calling LimitOrder.sol#announceLimitOrder function.
Next attacker set tokenId1 as pending to LeverageClose by calling DelayedOrder.sol#announceLeverageClose function.
Next attacker unlock tokenId1 by calling LimitOrder.sol#cancelLimitOrder function.
Next attacker sell tokenId1 to user2.
After a short time, the pending order with LeverageClose type is executed by keeper and the margin of the position are sent to user1(attacker).

## Impact
Attacker can sell a position which is pending to close.
Thus the buyer of the position will lose fund deposited to buy the position.

## Recommendation
We recommend that check if the position is already locked when locking a position.
